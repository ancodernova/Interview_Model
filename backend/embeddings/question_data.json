    "question": ": Can you explain what a class is in OOP?",
    "answer": "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that work on the data into a single unit. Follow-up Question: Can you provide a real-life example? Real-life Example: Consider a class Car which defines attributes like color, brand, and methods like drive(), stop(). public class Car { String color; String brand; void drive() { System.out.println(brand + \" is driving.\"); } void stop() { System.out.println(brand + \" has stopped.\"); } } 2.

    "question": ": What is an object in OOP?",
    "answer": "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state and behavior defined by the class. Follow-up Question: Can you create an object from the Car class and use its methods? Real-life Example: A specific car like a red Toyota. public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Car myCar = new Car(); myCar.color = \"Red\"; myCar.brand = \"Toyota\"; myCar.drive(); myCar.stop(); } } 3.

    "question": ": What is encapsulation?",
    "answer": "Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit, restricting direct access to some components. Follow-up Question: Why is encapsulation important? Real-life Example: Think of a capsule that contains medicine inside it, preventing exposure to its contents. public class Person { private String name; private int age; // Getter and Setter methods public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } public int getAge() { return age; } public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; } } 4.

    "question": ": What does polymorphism mean?",
    "answer": "Polymorphism means \"many shapes\". It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, where the specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation. Follow-up Question: Can you demonstrate polymorphism with method overloading and overriding? Real-life Example: A person can be a teacher, a father, and a friend in different contexts. Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism): public class MathUtils { public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } public double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; } } Method Overriding (Run-Time Polymorphism): class Animal { void sound() { System.out.println(\"Animal makes a sound\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { void sound() { System.out.println(\"Dog barks\"); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Animal myDog = new Dog(); myDog.sound(); } } 5.

    "question": ": What is an abstract class?",
    "answer": "Use an abstract class when you want to share code among several closely related classes. Use an interface when you want to specify that a class must implement certain methods, regardless of where the class is in the inheritance hierarchy. 10. What is an Interface?",

    "id": "b94a0b35-0b82-46f3-992a-1033f15aa0e2",
    "question": ": What is an interface in Java?",
    "answer": "An interface is a reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface. Follow-up Question: Can you provide an example? interface Animal { void eat(); void travel(); } class Mammal implements Animal { public void eat() { System.out.println(\"Mammal eats\"); } public void travel() { System.out.println(\"Mammal travels\"); } public static void main(String[] args) { Mammal m = new Mammal(); m.eat(); m.travel(); } } Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface Abstract Class: 1. Implementation: An abstract class can have both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body). This allows the abstract class to provide some default behavior. abstract class Animal { abstract void sound(); void sleep() { System.out.println(\"Animal is sleeping\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { void sound() { System.out.println(\"Dog barks\"); } } 1. Constructors: Abstract classes can have constructors, which can be used to initialize fields of the class. abstract class Vehicle { String type; Vehicle(String type) { this.type = type; } abstract void move(); } class Car extends Vehicle { Car() { super(\"Car\"); } void move() { System.out.println(\"Car is moving\"); } } 1. Instance Variables: Abstract classes can have instance variables. abstract class Shape { String color; Shape(String color) { this.color = color; } abstract void draw(); } class Circle extends Shape { Circle(String color) { super(color); } void draw() { System.out.println(\"Drawing a \" + color + \" circle\"); } } 1. Inheritance: A class can inherit only one abstract class (single inheritance). This is because Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes. 2. Access Modifiers: Abstract class methods can have any visibility: public, protected, private. 3. Use Case: Use abstract classes when you have a base class that should provide some default behavior that subclasses can override or use as-is. It is suitable when there is a clear hierarchical relationship between classes. Interface: 1. Implementation: Interfaces cannot have any implementation for methods (prior to Java 8). From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default and static methods with implementation. interface Animal { void sound(); default void sleep() { System.out.println(\"Animal is sleeping\"); } } class Dog implements Animal { public void sound() { System.out.println(\"Dog barks\"); } } 1. Constructors: Interfaces cannot have constructors. They cannot be used to create objects directly. 2. Instance Variables: Interfaces can only have constants (static final variables). interface Constants { int MAX_SPEED = 120; // implicitly public, static, and final } 1. Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance). This is a way to overcome the limitation of single inheritance with classes. interface Animal { void eat(); } interface Mammal { void walk(); } class Dog implements Animal, Mammal { public void eat() { System.out.println(\"Dog eats\"); } public void walk() { System.out.println(\"Dog walks\"); } } 1. Access Modifiers: Interface methods are implicitly public. All methods in an interface are abstract (prior to Java 8), and cannot have any other visibility. 2. Use Case: Use interfaces when you want to define a contract for what a class can do, without dictating how it should do it. They are ideal for defining capabilities that can be shared across different classes that do not share a parent-child relationship. Summary Table: Feature Abstract Class Interface Method Implementation Can have both abstract and Can have default and static concrete methods methods (Java 8+) Constructors Can have constructors Cannot have constructors Instance Variables Can have instance variables Can only have static final variables Inheritance Supports single inheritance Supports multiple inheritance Access Modifiers Methods can have any Methods are implicitly public visibility Use Case Suitable for shared code Suitable for defining among related classes capabilities across classes Example Code for Abstract Class: abstract class Animal { abstract void sound(); void sleep() { System.out.println(\"Animal is sleeping\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { void sound() { System.out.println(\"Dog barks\"); } } Example Code for Interface: interface Animal { void sound(); default void sleep() { System.out.println(\"Animal is sleeping\"); } } class Dog implements Animal { public void sound() { System.out.println(\"Dog barks\"); } } By understanding the differences between abstract classes and interfaces, you can make more informed decisions about which to use in your Java programs based on the design requirements and constraints.",

    "answer": "→ Y), X is a super key. Example: Ensuring that all functional dependencies have a super key as their determinant. Follow-up Question: Can you give an example of a table in 2NF but not in 3NF? Answer: A table with columns (StudentID, CourseID, InstructorID, InstructorName) where InstructorName is dependent on InstructorID, not on (StudentID, CourseID). Q9. Differentiate between 2NF and 3NF with example. And also between 3NF and BCNF. 2NF vs. 3NF: 2NF: Removes partial dependencies. 3NF: Removes transitive dependencies. Example: If a table (StudentID, CourseID, InstructorName) is in 2NF but not in 3NF because InstructorName depends on InstructorID, which is not a primary key. 3NF vs. BCNF: 3NF: Removes transitive dependencies. BCNF: Ensures that every determinant is a super key. Example: A table (CourseID, InstructorID, CourseTime) where InstructorID → CourseTime but InstructorID is not a super key. Follow-up Question: What is a transitive dependency? Answer: A transitive dependency is when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute. Q10. What is data redundancy and how does normalization reduce that? Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places. Normalization reduces redundancy by ensuring that data is stored in only one place and referenced elsewhere, preventing duplicate data entries. Follow-up Question: What is an example of data redundancy? Answer: Storing a student's address in multiple tables, which can lead to inconsistencies if one instance is updated but others are not. Q11. What is the relationship between Normal Forms and partial dependency and transitive dependency? 1NF: Eliminates repeating groups and ensures atomicity. 2NF: Eliminates partial dependencies (a non-key attribute depends on part of a composite key). 3NF: Eliminates transitive dependencies (a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute). BCNF: Ensures that every determinant is a super key. Follow-up Question: Can a table be in BCNF but not in 3NF? Answer: No, if a table is in BCNF, it is also in 3NF because BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF. SQL Concepts Q12. What is SQL? SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. Follow-up Question: What are some common SQL operations? Answer: Common operations include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. Q13. What is DDL, DML, and DCL in SQL? DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines the structure of the database. Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP. DML (Data Manipulation Language): Manipulates data stored in the database . Commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. DCL (Data Control Language): Controls access to data in the database. Commands: GRANT, REVOKE. Follow-up Question: What does the ALTER command do? Answer: ALTER modifies the structure of an existing database object, such as a table. Q14. What is the difference between TRUNCATE, DELETE, and DROP commands? TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions. Cannot be rolled back. DELETE: Removes specific rows based on a condition. Can be rolled back. DROP: Deletes the entire table structure along with its data. Cannot be rolled back. Follow-up Question: Which command would you use to remove all rows from a table but keep the table structure? Answer: TRUNCATE. Q15. What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE clause? WHERE: Filters rows before any groupings are made. HAVING: Filters groups after the GROUP BY clause has been applied. Example: SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000 GROUP BY Department HAVING COUNT(*) > 10; Follow-up Question: Can HAVING be used without GROUP BY?

    "answer": "Answer: When a string is created using a literal, it is added to the string pool, a special memory area in the JVM that stores unique string literals. If the same literal is used again, the JVM refers to the existing string in the pool. When a string is created using new(), a new object is created in the heap memory, even if an identical string exists in the pool. Example: String s1 = \"Hello\"; // Literal, added to string pool String s2 = \"Hello\"; // Refers to the same object in string pool String s3 = new String(\"Hello\"); // New object in heap System.out.println(s1 == s2); // Outputs: true System.out.println(s1 == s3); // Outputs: false",

    "question": ": Explain mutable and immutable types in Python with examples. Mutable: Objects whose value can be changed after creation. Example: lists, dictionaries, sets. Immutable: Objects whose value cannot be changed after creation. Example: tuples, strings, integers. Follow-up Question: Why are strings considered immutable?",
    "answer": "Strings are considered immutable because once they are created, their contents cannot be changed or modified. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object. This immutability ensures that strings behave predictably and are suitable for use as dictionary keys or in multi-threaded environments. 12. PIP:",

    "question": ": Differentiate between shallow copy and deep copy. Shallow Copy: Creates a new object but inserts references to the original objects. Changes to the copied object's mutable elements will reflect in the original object. Deep Copy: Creates a completely new object with its own copy of the original object's elements. Changes to the copied object do not affect the original object. Follow-up Question: When would you use shallow copy instead of deep copy?",
    "answer": "Shallow copy is useful when you need a new collection with the same elements but don't need to create copies of nested objects. It saves memory and can be faster. Deep copy, on the other hand, is suitable when you need to modify the copied object independently of the original, especially when dealing with nested structures. 15. Python Memory Management:",

    "question": ": Explain Python memory management in detail. Automatic Memory Management: Python automatically manages memory through a mechanism called reference counting and garbage collection. Reference Counting: Each object contains a reference count that tracks the number of references to that object. When the count drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is deallocated. Garbage Collection: Python's garbage collector periodically looks for objects with zero reference count and reclaims their memory. Follow-up Question: How does Python handle memory fragmentation?",
    "answer": "Python's memory allocator handles fragmentation by using a combination of strategies like splitting blocks, merging adjacent free blocks, and occasionally moving objects. This helps in mitigating the impact of memory fragmentation on the performance of Python programs. 16. Operators:",

    "question": ": Can you explain operators in Python?",
    "answer": "Operators in Python are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They can be categorized into arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logical, bitwise, membership, and identity operators. Example: # Arithmetic operators x = 10 y = 5 print(x + y) # Addition print(x - y) # Subtraction print(x * y) # Multiplication print(x / y) # Division print(x % y) # Modulus print(x ** y) # Exponentiation # Comparison operators print(x == y) # Equal to print(x != y) # Not equal to print(x > y) # Greater than print(x < y) # Less than 17.

    "answer": "Python has four levels of variable scopes: Local Scope: Variables defined within a function. Enclosing Scope: Variables in the local scope of enclosing functions (for nested functions). Global Scope: Variables defined at the top level of a module. Built-in Scope: Variables built into the Python interpreter. Example: x = 10 # Global scope def my_function(): y = 5 # Local scope print(x) # Accessing global variable my_function() 22.
